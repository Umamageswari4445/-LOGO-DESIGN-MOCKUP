# TASK -1  LOGO-DESIGN-MOCKUP - DESCRIPTION :

As part of the "Logo Design Mockup" task, the objective was to design and showcase logo concepts in a professional manner using Figma. 
The instructions required exploring 2–3 variations of a logo through the use of Figma’s design tools, with the final output being a shared Figma file
containing the mockup and design process.

To execute this task, I chose to recreate and mock up existing, recognizable logos *(such as Adidas, YouTube, Twitter, Figma , and LinkedIn)*, experimenting with minor design variations to understand the design principles and construction behind them. This approach helped me study real-world brand identities while practicing the core techniques of logo design.

I began by creating a new Figma file under a project titled “Logo Design Mockup” and framed the workspace appropriately using the Frame tool. 
I used the Auto Layout feature to structure my mockups consistently and neatly across the canvas, ensuring responsiveness and alignment between elements.

*For each logo variation, I made use of Tools like :*

 - > Shape tools (Rectangle, Ellipse, Polygon, etc.) to construct foundational forms

 - > Line tools to align and segment elements or build custom design details

 - > Text tool to recreate brand typography or introduce alternate font styles

 - > Fill and stroke settings to apply accurate brand colors and outline effects

 - > Color picker to match logo colors from the reference image accurately

 - > Grouping (Ctrl+G) and Component creation to organize repeated elements

One of the key learning aspects during this process was the use of grouping and layering. By organizing elements into groups and managing their Z-order (forward/backward),
I was able to simulate depth, overlay effects, and balanced spacing.
Another powerful feature I utilized was Auto Layout — especially useful when experimenting with responsive designs or when aligning icons beside text in a logo unit.
For instance, in recreating the LinkedIn logo, I placed the icon and text within an auto layout frame to test spacing and scale across different variations.

I also paid close attention to font styles, spacing, and visual hierarchy. I experimented with fonts that closely resembled the originals but also tried alternative 
fonts to test how small changes in typography can alter the brand feel. I noted that bold vs. light weight fonts drastically change the tone and perceived trustworthiness of a logo.

Each logo set is presented with its original reference (added as an image for comparison), followed by my own recreated and reimagined designs. I’ve added labels and annotations where needed to explain the changes in each variation (e.g., font change, color tweak, spacing adjustment).

This exercise helped reinforce key logo design principles such as simplicity, scalability, memorability, and balance. Figma’s design environment enabled rapid iteration and clear structuring of ideas, especially with its collaborative features, even though this particular task was done individually.

Overall, this project not only strengthened my design tool proficiency in Figma but also enhanced my visual analysis of brand identities and my ability to execute clean, thoughtful mockups.
